## Notes

I was able to get a lot farther on this app than I have previous apps. I finished the required user stories in the first two days, whereas the required stories took me the whole assignment period to complete on the previous assignments. The most important skill I learned was how to implement fragment views, which will be very useful when creating my own app. I struggled a bit with my profile section – I got it working at some point, but somehow it stopped showing the user's images and I could not figure out what had gone wrong.
